# Translation Scripts

This github repo is a WIP, that provides machine translation via LLMs

- initially I developed against local models, but have decided to move it towards using APIs
- APIs used are to be used with commercial providers who do not use the data for training models.


## Leadership Board

Currently gemini is leading on the leadership board and is very competitive for pricing, this is the set of models I am focusing on.


## Tooling

- devenv.sh
- git-crypt
- python
- shell scripts
